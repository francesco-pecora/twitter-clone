# twitter-clone

Here's a simple implementation of a Twitter application.

The user can't spam the application. There is a limiter in place interrupting the page if too many requests are done (and the input form disappears).

The user is not allowed to send bad words. They are just blurred with ****.

Users can only delete their own tweets (based on IP address).
